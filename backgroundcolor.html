    <h1>India</h1>
    <p>India, officially the Republic of India, is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area;
        the most populous country as of June 2023; and from the time of its independence in 1947, the world's most
        populous democracy.Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years
        ago.Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made
        the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity. Settled life emerged on the
        subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus
        Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European
        language, had diffused into India from the northwest. Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the
        Rigveda. Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely vigilant, the Rigveda records the dawning of
        Hinduism in India. The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.
        By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,and Buddhism and Jainism had
        arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity. Early political consolidations gave rise to the
        loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin. Their collective era was suffused with
        wide-ranging creativity, but also marked by the declining status of women,and the incorporation of
        untouchability into an organised system of belief. In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported
        Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.
