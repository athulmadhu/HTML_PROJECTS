    <h2>GIT HUB </h2>
    <p style="margin: 50px 100px 50px 10px;">GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source version control software that lets multiple people
        make separate changes to web pages at the same time. As Carpenter notes, because it allows for real-time
        collaboration, GitHub encourages teams to work together to build and edit their site content.
        GitHub allows multiple developers to work on a single project at the same time, reduces the risk of duplicative
        or conflicting work, and can help decrease production time. With GitHub, developers can build code, track
        changes, and innovate solutions to problems that might arise during the site development process simultaneously.
        Non-developers can also use it to create, edit, and update website content, which Carpenter demonstrates in her
        tutorial.
